# 										Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

Note: This dataset was created using variables and observations from *x_train.txt*, *y_train.txt*, *subject_train.txt*, *x_test.txt*, *y_test.txt*, *subject_test.txt*, *features.txt* and *activity_labels.txt*.
	  Values from *Inertial Signals* were **not** considered since they were redundant for what the question had demanded.
